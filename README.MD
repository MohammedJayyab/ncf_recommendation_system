## Model Performance

The recommendation model has been evaluated using several key performance metrics. Below is a detailed explanation of each metric and the model's performance:

### 1. **Accuracy: 0.8322 (83.22%)**

- **What it means**: This means that 83.22% of the predictions made by the model are correct. In a binary classification problem like this (predicting interaction vs. no interaction), an accuracy above 80% is typically considered a good performance. However, accuracy alone doesn't give the full picture, especially if the dataset is imbalanced.

### 2. **Precision: 0.7894 (78.94%)**

- **What it means**: Of all the products that the model predicted the user would interact with, 78.94% were correct. Precision is important when you want to minimize false positives (i.e., recommending a product that the user is unlikely to interact with).
- **When to focus on precision**: If your goal is to recommend fewer but more relevant products, increasing precision is essential.

### 3. **Recall: 0.8656 (86.56%)**

- **What it means**: Of all the products that the user actually interacted with, the model correctly predicted 86.56% of them. Recall is important when you want to ensure you recommend all potentially relevant products, even if some irrelevant ones are also recommended.
- **When to focus on recall**: If you want to ensure that users don't miss out on good product recommendations, recall is a critical metric to optimize.

### 4. **F1-Score: 0.8258 (82.58%)**

- **What it means**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two. A score of 82.58% shows that the model has a good balance between making relevant recommendations and minimizing irrelevant ones.
- **Why F1 is useful**: It provides a single score that balances precision and recall, which is useful when you need to balance both avoiding false positives and catching all relevant items.

### 5. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.2398**

- **What it means**: On average, the model's predicted probability of interaction differs from the actual value by 0.2398. This measures how close the predictions are to the true interactions, with lower values indicating better performance.
- **Why MAE matters**: MAE is a simple and intuitive measure of error, where smaller values mean the model's predictions are closer to the true values.

### 6. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.3434**

- **What it means**: RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors, penalizing larger errors more heavily than MAE. The value of 0.3434 indicates that, while the model generally makes good predictions, there are some larger errors occasionally.
- **Why RMSE matters**: RMSE is useful when you want to penalize large prediction errors more heavily than small ones.

### Summary

- **High recall** (86.56%) means the model is effective at recommending products that users are likely to interact with, ensuring that most relevant items are not missed.
- **Strong precision** (78.94%) ensures that the model doesnâ€™t recommend too many irrelevant products.
- **Accuracy** is solid at 83.22%, but it's important to remember that accuracy alone might not tell the full story if the dataset is imbalanced.
- **Low MAE and RMSE** indicate that the model is making predictions that are close to the actual interactions, with few large errors.

If you want to further improve the model, consider whether you want to prioritize **Precision** (to make fewer but more accurate recommendations) or **Recall** (to ensure you recommend all potentially relevant items).
